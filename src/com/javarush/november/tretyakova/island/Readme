This application is a model of an island with different inhabitants. All residents are divided into
three groups: predators (bear, boa constrictor, eagle, fox, wolf), herbivores (boar, buffalo, caterpillar, deer, duck, goat,
Horse, Mouse, Rabbit, Sheep) and plants.
The island model includes a number of locations (cells), each of which has its own inhabitants.
When you run the program, each cell gets a random number of random types of inhabitants.
After each cycle, the following actions take place:
 - all animals try to eat (if there is their food in the current location);
 - all animals try to breed (if there are animals of the same type in the location);
 - all animals (survivors) try to move.
Animals and plants could be eaten, animals could starve to death (in case the current cell does not contain
 type of objects that can be considered as food).

 After each tick, we get a Statistical Report, which presents data on the current number of each type of inhabitants
 of the island, on the number of newborns and deaths, as well as the number of the current day.
